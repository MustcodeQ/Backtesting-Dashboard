## API Integratiion
To enable live cryptocurrency prices and latest news:

Obtain an API key for cryptocurrency prices (e.g., CoinGecko API or CoinMarketCap API).
Obtain an API key for news updates (e.g., NewsAPI).
Update the API keys in your Django project's settings or environment variables:
```bash
# Example: settings.py
CRYPTO_API_KEY = 'your-crypto-api-key'
NEWS_API_KEY = 'your-news-api-key'
```


## How It Works
The Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your trading activities.
API calls fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices and news, displayed dynamically.
Users can navigate through sections like Strategy Overview, Performance Analytics, and Trades Log for detailed insights.
The Streamlit application visualizes detailed analytics and graphs for strategy performance.

## Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è Without API keys, live data for cryptocurrency prices and news will not work.
Ensure proper configuration of environment variables for API keys.
The Streamlit app must run separately from the Django server.
